# flashcard-generator

This app allows you to create two types of flashcards (Basic and Cloze). 

A basic card has the question on the front and the answer on the back.

A cloze card displays a fact with part of it missing. The user has to fill in the blank.

The user can play the flashcard game and create new cards.
